# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is The Textual Commons?

The Textual Commons is a public, transparency-first archive for early Judeo-Christian texts and fresh translations from original languages.

It exists to make texts visible without doctrinal gatekeeping, harmonization, or forced conclusions.

---

## Is this a religious or theological project?

It is a **textual** project.

The Textual Commons does not promote or oppose belief. It does not determine doctrine, authority, or meaning. It preserves and presents texts so readers can encounter them directly.

---

## Is this a new Bible or canon?

No.

This project does not create a canon, revise scripture, or declare any text authoritative. Canonical and non-canonical texts are presented side by side without hierarchy.

---

## Why include non-canonical or disputed texts?

Because they exist.

Early Jewish and Christian communities produced many texts that were copied, read, debated, and rejected in different places and times. Excluding them distorts the historical record.

Inclusion does not imply agreement or authority.

---

## Are you creating new translations?

Yes — but in a limited and careful sense.

The Textual Commons hosts **fresh, provisional translations** produced directly from original-language sources. These translations are not offered as definitive or superior to existing ones.

They exist to expose language, ambiguity, and textual difficulty.

Every translation here is a draft, not a destination.

---

## Why are there so few notes or explanations?

Because explanation is not the goal.

Translations are allowed to stand on their own. Notes appear only when necessary to flag ambiguity, variant readings, or uncertainty in the source material.

Interpretive commentary is intentionally restrained.

---

## How are contradictions handled?

They are preserved.

Contradictions are treated as historical data, not problems to be solved. No attempt is made to harmonize or resolve tensions between texts.

---

## Are later traditions included?

Yes, but they are clearly dated and labeled.

Later texts are not backdated into early history. They are preserved as reception history, memory, or expansion traditions.

---

## What about claims without surviving texts?

Claims without accessible textual evidence are recorded transparently and labeled as unsubstantiated.

They are not treated as evidence unless material appears. They remain open to future discovery.

---

## Could future discoveries change the archive?

Yes.

This project is intentionally open-ended. New manuscripts, fragments, or credible evidence can lead to reclassification or expansion.

Nothing here is final. Everything is traceable.

---

## Do I need to be a scholar to contribute?

No.

Helpful contributions include:
- suggesting texts or sources
- assisting with transcription
- contributing translations
- verifying metadata
- flagging ambiguity or variants

Care matters more than credentials.

## Who decides what gets included?

Inclusion is based on:
- the existence of a tex
