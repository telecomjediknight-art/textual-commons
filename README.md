# The Textual Commons

A transparency-first archive for early Judeo-Christian texts and fresh translations from original languages.

This project exists to make texts visible without doctrinal gatekeeping, harmonization, or forced conclusions.

The text itself is the primary artifact.

## What this is

The Textual Commons is an open, public archive dedicated to preserving and presenting the full textual record surrounding the Judeo-Christian world.

It brings together:
- early biblical texts
- non-canonical Jewish and Christian writings
- parallel manuscript traditions
- fresh, provisional translations from original languages

Texts are presented so they can be encountered directly.

---

## What this is not

This project does not:
- define belief or orthodoxy
- create a new canon
- harmonize contradictions
- resolve ambiguity
- smooth texts for devotional clarity

Inclusion does not imply agreement or authority.

---

## Text-first approach

Translations in this archive are allowed to stand on their own.

Notes, when present, exist only to:
- identify linguistic ambiguity
- flag variant readings
- mark uncertainty in the source material

They are not used to guide interpretation.

Readers are trusted to encounter the text directly.

---

## Fresh translations

The Textual Commons supports fresh, provisional translations produced directly from original-language sources.

These translations are:
- source-facing
- minimally interpretive
- clearly labeled as drafts
- open to review and revision

They are not offered as definitive or superior to existing translations.

Every translation here is a draft, not a destination.

---

## A living archive

This project is open-ended.

New discoveries are welcome.  
Claims without accessible textual evidence are recorded transparently.  
Classifications can change when better evidence appears.

Nothing here is final. Everything is traceable.

---

## How to engage

You do not need to agree with a text to help preserve it.

Ways to participate include:
- suggesting texts or sources
- assisting with transcription
- contributing translations
- verifying metadata
- flagging ambiguity or variants

Care matters more than credentials.

## Orientation

> This project treats the textual tradition as a painting, not a diagram.  
> Texts are placed in relation, not forced into resolution.

---

## Status

Structure is forming. Contributions are welcome.
